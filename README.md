# airbnb CSS challenge

## Learning Outcomes

- Practice implementing a design with CSS
- Practice writing CSS using pre-defined variables (a style guide)
- Exposure to [BEM](https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/), a CSS class-naming convention
- To see an example of a well structured semantic HTML and CSS

## Task

Your task is to implement the following **mobile design** using CSS. 

**Notes:**

- Read the HTML, but you shouldn't change it.
- We have provided **CSS Variables** to be used in the style rules. You should use them but you do not need to edit the definitions!
- We have provided empty CSS rules for all the classes in the html. Not every CSS rule needs to be filled.

</p>

## CSS Variables

We have defined some [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables) to be used in style rules. Check them out at the top of the `main.css` file.

Variable definition:

```css
html {
  --spacing-x-large: 4rem;
}
```

How to use them:

```css
.my-class {
  margin: var(--spacing-x-large);
}
```

### Colours

Here you can see a screenshot from my editor, displaying the colours which we have defined for you:
